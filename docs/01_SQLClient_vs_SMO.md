The two approaches in the PowerShell scripts (`10_CreatingViews.ps1` and `09_CreatingViews.ps1`) differ in how they connect to the SQL Server and execute database operations. Here’s a comparison table outlining the **pros** and **cons** of each approach:

| Approach              | **10_CreatingViews.ps1**                                              | **09_CreatingViews.ps1**                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection Type**   | Direct connection using `.NET SQL Client` with connection string      | PowerShell's SQL Server Management Object (SMO) library                                                   |
| **Connection String** | Uses a manual connection string with credentials                      | Utilizes SQL Server's `Set-Location` in PowerShell SQL Provider                                           |
| **Database Context**  | Establishes context in a specific database with connection string     | Sets context through `Set-Location` to navigate SQL Server hierarchy                                      |
| **Object Creation**   | Direct SQL commands (e.g., `CREATE VIEW`) via SQL Command text        | SMO's .NET objects to define and manage SQL Server objects                                                |
| **Execution**         | Executes raw SQL commands via `System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand`      | Uses SMO's methods for creating, managing, and dropping SQL objects                                       |
| **Error Handling**    | Requires manual error handling for connection and execution           | Some SMO methods have built-in checks and methods, potentially reducing need for extensive error handling |
| **Authentication**    | Requires SQL Server Authentication credentials (`sa` and password)    | Can use both Windows Authentication and SQL Authentication                                                |
| **Compatibility**     | Works well with any SQL Server, but relies heavily on .NET SQL client | Requires SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) installed on the machine                                     |
| **Ease of Use**       | Straightforward for developers familiar with connection strings       | Easier for SQL administrators familiar with SMO and SQL Server hierarchy                                  |
| **Flexibility**       | Can be used with other databases that support SQL client connections  | Limited to SQL Server-specific tasks; highly integrated with SQL Server                                   |
| **Portability**       | Portable to non-SQL Server environments                               | SQL Server-specific; SMO dependency limits portability                                                    |
| **Dependencies**      | Only requires .NET and SQL client libraries                           | Requires PowerShell SQLServer module with SMO installed                                                   |

### Pros and Cons

| Approach                 | **Pros**                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Cons**                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **10_CreatingViews.ps1** | - Familiar for developers who use raw SQL queries and connection strings <br> - Can be used with any SQL Server, as it only relies on connection strings <br> - Greater flexibility in handling custom SQL statements | - Hardcoded credentials in the script introduce security risk <br> - Requires manual handling of SQL statements <br> - Additional code needed for complex operations                                              |
| **09_CreatingViews.ps1** | - Leverages SMO objects, making it more PowerShell-specific for SQL Server <br> - Built-in methods reduce manual handling of complex SQL operations <br> - No need to write raw SQL commands                          | - Only works with SQL Server and SMO libraries (less portable) <br> - Dependency on PowerShell's SMO provider, which may require additional setup <br> - Less control over raw SQL commands, limiting flexibility |

### Which One to Choose?

- **Use `10_CreatingViews.ps1` (Direct SQL Client Approach)** if:

  - You need a portable script that can work with other databases or non-SQL Server environments.
  - You prefer raw SQL commands and want fine-grained control over SQL execution.
  - Security for credentials is well-managed, and you’re okay with handling connections and queries manually.

- **Use `09_CreatingViews.ps1` (PowerShell SMO Approach)** if:
  - You are exclusively working with SQL Server, and SMO is available in your environment.
  - You prefer to avoid raw SQL commands and want to use SMO's methods for ease.
  - You want built-in support for SQL Server management tasks with reduced manual SQL handling.

**Security Note**: Hardcoding credentials in `10_CreatingViews.ps1` can be a security risk. For better security practices, consider using secure credential storage like the **Windows Credential Manager** or **Azure Key Vault** if running in the cloud.
